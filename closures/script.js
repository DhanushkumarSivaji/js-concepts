// function along with its lexical environment bundled together forms the closure.In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function

function x() {
    var a = 7;
     function y() {
         console.log(a);
     }
     return y;
}

var z = x();

console.log(z())
//..... after thousands of line. when u invoke z() it still prints 7. but after return the whole execution context is 
// destroyed but because of closure we can achieve this


function z1(){
    var b = 100;
    function x(){
        var a = 7;
        function y(){
            console.log(a,b)
        }
        y()
    }
    x()
}

z1()

// uses of closure

// 1. Module Design Pattern
// 2. Currying
// 3. Functions like once
// 4. memoize
// 5. maintaining state in async world
// 6. setTimeouts
// 7. Iterators
// 8. and many more



// Disadvantages of closure

 // Over consumption of memory in closures, whenever a closure is formed there is a over consumption of memory and those closure variables are not garbage collected till the program expires

// Closures prevent variables inside functions from being released by memory. These variables will occupy memory and consume a lot of memory, which may lead to memory leakage

// The solution to this problem is to delete all unnecessary local variables in time when these variables are not used
