// memory allocation is done automatically

// As long as references exit there will not be any cleaning or garbage collecting (Mark & Sweep Algorithm)

// If a location is unreachable then that will be collected and released as garbage



// Garbage Collector

// It s like a program in the browser or the JS engine which kind of frees up the unutilized memory (by removing the unutilized variables)


// JS is a like a high level programming language, In other programming language like C, or C++ It s upto developers that how we take memory, how we access to memory
// how allocate memory and how to deallocate memory. But in JS engine most of the work is done by the JS engine.
